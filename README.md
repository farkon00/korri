__Korri__ is a simple programming language built and compiled in Rust as practice for making programming languages.

Currently __Korri__ requires all tokens to be separated by a ' ' (space) however this will be different in the future.

## Usage

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/morrigan-plus-plus/korri.git
$ cd korri
$ cargo run [.korri file path]
```

If `cargo` is not installed, install it from [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).
